4. Do → Start or Schedule

If “Do” (green → Urgent & Important) {
	Todo goes to your list of the day (schedule) → DO IT NOW! → Close screen and start timer
}
elsif “Decide” (blue → Not Urgent & Important) {
	Todo is put in calendar (schedule for specific day in future) → SCHEDULE A TIME TO DO IT (PERIOD OF TIME) → open window to define details
}
elsif “Delegate” (red → Urgent & Not Important) {
	Todo is created and you're asked to share with someone → WHO CAN DO IT FOR YOU? → open window to define details → asked to share with delegate
}
else (“Delete” → grey → Not Import & Not Urgent) {
	Add todo to “collection” (ideas) for later prioritisation ( → make it Do/Decide/Delegate at later time)
