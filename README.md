<p><strong>Overall “idea (philosophy)”:</strong><br/>
Getting Things Done: https://gettingthingsdone.com/</p>

Popular and complete App:
OmniFocus: https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/web/

Eisenhower Matrix:
https://asana.com/resources/eisenhower-matrix
→ How to prioritise your todo; ie “categories” for your app
https://luxafor.com/the-eisenhower-matrix/
→ lots of definition and “use case” examples

Share functionality:
Todo Details with delegate

UX (Windows/Screens) Elements:
Welcome & Sign-in (incl. “Menu ie Navbar”) → User Settings page
User Window → App Overview (“Matrix”)
User Window → Create Task (Modal)
Do → Start or Schedule

If “Do” (green → Urgent & Important) {
	Todo goes to your list of the day (schedule) → DO IT NOW! → Close screen and start timer
}
elsif “Decide” (blue → Not Urgent & Important) {
	Todo is put in calendar (schedule for specific day in future) → SCHEDULE A TIME TO DO IT (PERIOD OF TIME) → open window to define details
}
elsif “Delegate” (red → Urgent & Not Important) {
	Todo is created and you're asked to share with someone → WHO CAN DO IT FOR YOU? → open window to define details → asked to share with delegate
}
else (“Delete” → grey → Not Import & Not Urgent) {
	Add todo to “collection” (ideas) for later prioritisation ( → make it Do/Decide/Delegate at later time)
}


Extension goals:
Categories for Delete
Premium features
Track time
